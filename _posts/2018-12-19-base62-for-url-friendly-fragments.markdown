Discourse [uses base62 for url friendly fragments for file upload urls](https://meta.discourse.org/t/quick-image-resizing-and-markdown-image-dimensions/66812/30) and the reason is made clear by [this comment](https://meta.discourse.org/t/quick-image-resizing-and-markdown-image-dimensions/66812/30):

>(note that weâ€™ll need to use base62 3, to avoid the / and + chars in URLs though)

And this is the Ruby library they use: https://github.com/steventen/base62-rb
